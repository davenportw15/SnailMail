SnailMail
=========

Send email like it's the 1800s.


SnailMail allows you to send email at the rate of ordinary mail. The delay in the delivery of your SnailMail is
determined by the distance between you and the recipient.

SnailMail was developed at LexHack 2014, responding to the given theme of "the past."

SnailMail uses Python, Flask, Angular.js and SQLite.
